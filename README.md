# Aion Documentation Code Examples

This repository holds all the code examples used in [Aion Documentation](https://docs.aion.network). The purpose of this repository is to make it easier to find the examples and code-snippets you're looking for. Also, having all the examples in once place will make it easier to keep things consistent across guides and tutorials.

Each example contains a `README.md` file explaining what the example is attempting to explain, how to run it, and a basic overview of the example itself.

## Sections

The code examples are split into the following sections:

### Contracts

These examples are specific to Java contract creation. They do not contains any setup or configuration files, unlike the [IntelliJ Plugin](#section-intellij-plugin)) and [Maven CLI](#section-maven-cli) examples.

### Ethers.js

These examples show how to use Ethers.js as a frontend JavaScript framework for your Java blockchain applications.

### IntelliJ Plugin

These examples are specific to using the IntelliJ IDE with the Aion4j plugin. These examples may be similar to [Maven CLI](#maven-cli), and [Contract](#contracts) examples, but have been built using the IntelliJ IDE so they might have a different folder structure. They have been designed to be directly imported into IntelliJ.

### Maven CLI

These examples are specific to using the Maven CLI. These examples may be similar to [IntelliJ Plugin](#maven-cli), and [Contract](#contracts) examples, but have been built using the Maven CLI so they might have a different folder structure. Projects within this section have been designed to be directly ran using the Maven CLI.

### Web3J

These examples show how to integrate a Java blockchain application into a standard Java application using the Web3J framework.

### Web3.js

These examples show how to use Web3.js as a frontend JavaScript framework for your Java blockchain applications.
