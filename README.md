# Aion Documentation Code Examples

This repository holds all the code examples used in [Aion Documentation](https://docs.aion.network). The purpose of this repository is to make it easier to find the examples and code-snippets you're looking for. Also, having all the examples in once place will make it easier to keep things consistent across guides and tutorials.

Each example contains a `README.md` file explaining what the example is attempting to explain, how to run it, and a basic overview of the example itself.

## Contributions

If you want to suggest a change to a code example or snippet, create an [issue](https://github.com/aionnetwork/docs-examples/issues). Keep in mind that one example may be used across several different guides and tutorials.

## Maintenance
