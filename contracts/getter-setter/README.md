# Getter Setter

This project is a simple _getter-setter_ blockchain application written using IntelliJ and the Aion4j plugin.

## Setup

The easiest way to import this project is to create a new project using either the IntelliJ Plugin or Maven CLI. Once you have a base project setup, copy and paste both the `GetterSetter.java` and `GetterSetterTest.java` files into your project. You will also likely have to change the `package aionexample;` lines and your `pom.xml` file.

## Explanation

There are two major directories in this project, `src/main/java/docsexample` and `src/test/java/docsexample`. The `HelloAvm.java` file is the contract that will be deployed to the test network, and the `GetterSetterRuleTest.java` contains the test cases for the contract.
